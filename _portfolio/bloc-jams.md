## Explanation
Bloc Jams was the very first app I built during my time at Bloc. Being a front-end project, there was heavy emphasis on strong visual design that went hand in hand with Javascript programming logic. The end goal was to create an online Spotify replica that could thoeretically be used by anyone, from any device! 

## Problem
Being my first project, Bloc Jams pushed me to acquire deeper knowledge of even the most basic programming concepts. I had some previous experience in HTML/CSS, as well as Javascript. This project pushed me to:

⋅⋅* Create a music player that not only responds to basic commands (start, play, pause, skip) but allows dyanmic content to generate the music itself. 
⋅⋅* Learn about the Document Object Model (DOM) & JQuery, inlcuding the best programming practices, and refractoring code as needed.
⋅⋅* Completely refractor my DOM & Jquery with AngularJS while learning the ins and outs of an SPA web application.

## Solution
Having to jump between the DOM, Jquery and then AngularJS was quite challenging. It's like someone telling you "Congrats on reciting the alphabet, now do it again, only this time it needs to be in a different language." After a while I started to see the various patterns they followed and it became easier to wrap my head around the problems presented. Obviously the syntax is different, but the functionality remained the same.

## Results
Going from the DOM to Jquery was a breath of fresh air. Although the DOM is vanilla Javascript and JQuery is a library, cutting down on the total amount of code written is always a positive. Going from JQuery to AngularJS was a bit more challenging, as I had to expand my knowledge from coding and probelm solving to creating an actual web based application with SPA functionality. 

## Conclusion
In the end, Bloc Jams was a success! A dynamic music player with the full functionality you'd expect from one. Going from page to page is a snap, and changing songs is as simple as point, click, done!
