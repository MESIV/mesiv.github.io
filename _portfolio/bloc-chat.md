## Explanation
Bloc Chat was the second app I built during my time at Bloc, immediately coming after my completion of Bloc Jams. Like Bloc Jams, this was built using the AngularJS framework. But since this is a chat room based application it required the use of a database to store data. This happened to be my very first time using/learning Firebase!

## Problem
While I was quite familiar with AngularJS, I never worked with databases so this presented a new set of challenges to overcome. This project taught me to:

⋅⋅*Set up a firebase account and configure its settings 
⋅⋅*How to reference the database inside the Angular code 
⋅⋅*Creating and using cookies to keep track of data such as usernames from the app 

## Solution
Having built Bloc Jams in AngularJS, I felt quite comfortable using the framework to build my app. But once I added the Firebase functionality it felt like an entire new language. What helped me the most was browsing stackoverflow and going through the Angular/Firebase documentation. I heavily relied on Bloc's previous lessons and resources to help get me through most assignments. Branching out and doing my own research is what helped me push through and get answers that ultimately led to the creation of this project!

## Results
While in hindsight I should've spent more time doing my own research in previous assignments to help prepare me for the real world, Bloc Chat definitely set me on the right path. Learning the ins and outs of syntax is usefull, but knowing the right questions to ask google and where to look is just as important in my opinion.

## Conclusion
In the end, Bloc Chat was up and running! It's a fully functional chat room with the options to create new rooms, change the username and send messages. If this was the early 2000s I'd have a booming business!
